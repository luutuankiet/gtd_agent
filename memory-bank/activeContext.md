## Current Focus

- 2025-07-29 23:34:52 - User wants to understand RAG database building with Langchain and Chroma, specifically regarding chunk size and effective RAG document building for a document expert agent.
- 2025-07-29 23:37:17 - The primary use case for the document expert agent is a coding assistant to help refactor Lightdash semantic models.
- 2025-07-30 01:31:20 - User has successfully run the embedding process with default settings, creating a local `chroma.sqlite3` database. They need to understand the `.md` file content, chunking strategy, and the Chroma DB schema within the RAG end-to-end workflow.
*   2025-08-10 03:06:00 - The current focus is to establish a robust, quantitative performance baseline for the RAG-based Document Support Agent, as outlined in `latest_status_quo.md`.
