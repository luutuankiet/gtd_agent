##  Create a new project
Only users with organization admin permissions can create new projects.
To create a new project, click on `settings` —> `project management` —> `create new project`. Give your project a nice, new name, then get started on setting up the dbt and warehouse connection.
##  Set up the dbt + warehouse connection
You’ll need to define the dbt and warehouse connections for your new project. Not sure what it all means? Don’t worry, we’ve written a step-by-step guide that will help you out.
##  Easily switch between projects
Once you’ve got multiple projects set up, you can easily switch through the projects in your organization using the drop-down list in the top corner of your screen.
##  Go to the project management settings to delete a project
Don’t need a project anymore? That’s okay - you can easily delete a project in the project settings space.
Only users with admin permissions can delete projects.
