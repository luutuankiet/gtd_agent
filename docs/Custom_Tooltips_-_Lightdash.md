By default, tooltips will show the x-axis value, the y-axis field name, and the y-axis value, like this: You can customize tooltips to show additional metrics or table calculations from your results table. You can even include notes, links, or custom formatting for additional context. To use this feature, go to **Configure chart > Display > Custom Tooltip**.
HTML is allowed in the Custom tooltip code, but Javascript is disabled.
You can also select variables from your chart, from any of the axes, even on grouped charts. Start typing the name of the field, and weâ€™ll autocomplete with the right variable. Here is an example code block for a custom tooltip:

```
<strong>ðŸ’° Profit this month:</strong>
 ${dbt_orders_sum_of_profit}
<br>
<strong>ðŸ›’ Average basket this month:</strong>
 ${dbt_orders_average_of_basket_total}
<br>
<strong>ðŸ’³ Total Orders this month:</strong>
 ${dbt_orders_count_distinct_order_id}

```

The above code will look like this in the tooltip: Custom tooltips will show up on saved charts, dashboards, and the code will be included in dashboards as code downloads.
If you need to show some data that is not included in the chart (eg: a dynamic URL, or an ID) , you can even create a table calculation, and include it on on the chart as an extra axis to use this variable on the tooltip.
