##  Exploring version history
To access version history, click on the `Version History` option under the three dot menu when viewing or editing a chart. This takes you to the version history of the chart where you can see the previous versions of the chart including information around who authored the previous versions as well as when they were udpated. You can preview any previous version by clicking on it. Once you’re happy with the version you want, you can click on the three dot menu next to the version you want to restore the chart to.
Lightdash saves all iterations of your chart, so reverting to a previous version does not delete any existing history.
###  Missing some versions?
Version History is limited depending on the tier of Lightdash Cloud you’re using:
  * Cloud Starter: 3 days
  * Cloud Pro: 30 days
  * Cloud Enterprise: 60 days

Speak to the team if you’re interested in moving tier to get access to more history.
