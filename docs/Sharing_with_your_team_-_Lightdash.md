  * 1. Share a URL to work in progress
  * 2. Share a link to a saved chart
  * 3. Download results as a table or chart


In Lightdash there are three primary ways to share insights with your team:
  * Share a URL to a ‘work-in-progress’ data exploration
  * Share a link to a saved chart
  * Download results as a .csv or a .png of the chart


###  1. Share a URL to work in progress
As you explore your data in Lightdash, the URL contains a unique link to your work in progress. Copy and paste the url while you’re exploring data and anybody with access to your Lightdash project can jump into the Explore view at exactly the same point you’re at.
###  2. Share a link to a saved chart
##### Save your chart
You can create a new saved chart or update an existing saved chart by clicking the ‘Save chart’ button on the chart panel.
##### Share your chart
Everyone in your project has access to the saved charts. All they need to do is click on `saved charts` and they can see your finished work of chart art.
###  3. Download results as a table or chart
You can download your chart as .jpeg, .png, .svg, .pdf, or .json file by clicking the ‘Download’ button on the chart panel. You can also download your results table as a .CSV or export them to a Google Sheet, with just the click of a button. So, you can import data from Lightdash into other tools, or just save them on your computer for later.
