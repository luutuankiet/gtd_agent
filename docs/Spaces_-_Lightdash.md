Spaces are kind of like folders. All saved charts and dashboards exist in a Space and can only be in one Space at a time. To access Spaces, you can either select a Space from the drop-down list in `Browse` or you can click on the Lightdash icon and select your Space from the homepage.
##  Moving items between Spaces
To move a saved chart, dashboard or space between Spaces, you can click on the three dot menu (`...`) to the right of the item and pick the `Move` action. Or select items using checkboxes on the left and click `Move to Space`. You can also add items to a Space from within the Space. Just click on the `Add` button on the space page.
##  Updating and deleting Spaces
You can rename or delete your Space from All Spaces view or on the homescreen by clicking on the three-dot menu (`...`) for the Space.
Deleting a Space will delete all of the content in that Space.
##  Managing access to a Space
By default, when you create a Space, it is restricted so only you can access it (however, if you create a nested Space, it automatically inherits permissions from its parent). You can edit a Space to make it Restricted Access or Public Access. To edit access to a Space, navigate into the Space, then click the `share` button. From there, you can choose to make a space `Restricted Access` or `Public Access` (Only top level space access can be edited, nested spaces inherit permissions from their parent spaces). By default, in public spaces, a user’s space permissions are inherited from their project permissions. For example, if I’m a project viewer, I will get `Can View` access to a Space. There are three space roles: `Full Access`, `Can Edit`, `Can View` For more details about actions you can take in a Space based on your role, check out this table.
###  Restricted Access Spaces
**Only admins and members that are invited to a Space with Restricted Access have access to it.** For example, here I have a Space with Restricted Access. Only admins and the invited members have access to this Space. Katie, Filipe and Marshall have inherited `Full Access` because they are organization admins. Priyanka was invited to the space, so she has `Can View` access to the space. No one else in Lightdash can see or interact with the content in this Space unless they’re invited or become an admin. Only users with `Full Access` permissions to a Restricted Space can invite other users to that Space.
###  Public Spaces
**Everyone who has access to your project has access to a Public space.** For example, here I have a Space with Public access. Everyone who has access to my Project, “Lightdash analytics”, will get access to the content in my public space. **By default, you inherit your space permissions in a public space from your project permissions.** So, if someone is an `editor` in my project, they will have `Can Edit` permissions in my Space. If someone is a `viewer` in my project, they will have `Can View` permissions in my Space. For more details about actions you can take in a Space based on your role, check out this table. **Users with Full Access to the space can change a user’s space permissions.** In Public spaces (just like in restricted spaces), users who have `Full Access` to the space can change other users’ space permissions (except admins). Users cannot be removed from Public Spaces. To make a user have `no access` to a space, you must change the space from Public to Restricted.
