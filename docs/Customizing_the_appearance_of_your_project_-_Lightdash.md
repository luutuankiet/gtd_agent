To customize the colours used by default in your organization, head to the `Organization settings` â€”> `Appearance` and you can update any and all of your default colours used in your organization.
##  Update the default colours used in charts
You will see a list of colour palettes that you can choose from.
###  Create a new palette and preview it
You can also create your own palette by clicking on the `Add new palette` button. Here you can preview the palette before you save it.
###  Set the palette as the default
Once you have created your palette, you can set it as the default palette by clicking on the `Use this theme` button. You can always come back to this page to change the default palette.
##  Use the palette in a chart
The next time you build a chart, it will default to using these colours for the series, unless you override them in the chart config.
