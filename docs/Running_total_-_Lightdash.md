  * Hereâ€™s the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate a running total


Hereâ€™s an example of a running total: And hereâ€™s the SQL used in the table calculation:

```
SUM(${orders.total_order_amount}) OVER (
  ORDER BY
    ${orders.order_date_month}
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW


```

In general, the SQL used for calculating running totals has two bits (with an optional third bit):
  * `column_I_want_to_sum` - this is the column with the values you want to add up
  * `column_I_want_to_order_by` - this is the column you want to order your running total over
  * `optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by` - this column is optional and you can add as many more `order by` columns as you need. For your running total to only go up an increment of one row, youâ€™ll need to add every dimension in your results table to the `ORDER BY` bit in your SQL. And, the order of these will need to be the same as the ordering youâ€™ve added to the columns in your results table.

SUM(${table.column_I_want_to_sum}) OVER (
  ORDER BY
    ${table.column_I_want_to_order_by},
    ${table.optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by}
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW


```

**ðŸ’Ž Level up your SQL** :
  * You can specify if you want to order your columns in ascending order (1, 2, 3, 4) or descending order (4, 3, 2, 1) using the key words `ASC` and `DESC` in your `ORDER BY` clause. By default, a column will be ordered in ascending order - so if you want it ordered ascending, you donâ€™t need to add anything.
