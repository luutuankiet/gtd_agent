  * Enable Google SSO
  * Create an API key for Google file picker


###  Enable Google SSO
To authenticate Google users, first you need to enable Google SSO on your server. If you still want to keep users to login via email/password or another SSO provider, you can set this `AUTH_GOOGLE_ENABLED` variable to `false`
###  Create an API key for Google file picker
We use Google Drive picker API to allow you to select your spreadsheet files on `Syncs` To create a Google Drive picker API you need to add a new API key in APIs and services in Google Cloud. Your Google project must have the following APIâ€™s enabled:
  * Google Drive API
  * Google Picker API
  * Google Sheets API

Save the API key in a new environment variable `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY`
