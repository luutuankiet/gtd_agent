##  What this guide covers
Youâ€™ll learn how to use the `explores` config in Lightdash to define **multiple curated table experiences** from a single dbt model. Each explore appears as its own table in the **Query from tables** list in Lightdash.
##  When to use explores
Use the explores config when you want to create tailored versions of the same table for different teams or use cases. For example:
  * Show different columns or joins depending on the audience (e.g. Users + CRM for Sales, Users + product usage for PMs)
  * Customize each version of the table to match a specific workflow or department
  * Restrict access to certain versions or fields using user attributes (e.g. exec-only views, region-based filters, or hiding PII)


##  Quickstart
Start with your base model
This is your regular dbt model, for example, `deals`.
Copy

```
models:
name: deals
    meta:
      primary_key: deal_id

```

Add an explores section under meta
Use the `explores` config to define multiple versions of the table. Each explore has its own `label`, `joins`, joined fields, and access rules.
Copy
Ask AI
```
models:
name: deals
    meta:
      primary_key: deal_id
      label: Deals (Basic)
      description: Basic deals table with no joins
      explores:
        deals_accounts:
          label: Deals w/Accounts
          description: Deals table with accounts joined in, limited acount fields included
          joins:
join: accounts
              relationship: many-to-one
              sql_on: ${deals.account_id} = ${accounts.account_id}
              fields: [industry, segment, count_accounts]
        deals_exec_view:
          label: Deals (Exec View)
          description: Deals table with account info, for execs only, all acount fields included
          required_attributes:
            is_exec: "true"
          joins:
join: accounts
              relationship: many-to-one
              sql_on: ${deals.account_id} = ${accounts.account_id}

```

Preview the result in Lightdash
Once you commit and deploy your dbt changes:
  * Go to Query from tables in Lightdash
  * Youâ€™ll now see: 
    * **Deals (Basic)**
    * **Deals w/Accounts**
    * **Deals (Exec View)** (only visible to users with the required attribute)

Each shows up as its own table in the UI, but all use the same `deals` model.
##  Table config options you can use
Inside each explore definition, you can use any of the existing table config options, including:
  * `label`
  * `joins`
  * `sql_filter`
  * `description`
  * `default_filters`
  * `required_attributes`
