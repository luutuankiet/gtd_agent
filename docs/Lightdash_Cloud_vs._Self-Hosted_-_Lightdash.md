Self-hosting is great for hobbyist projects or if you want to go wild with a completely custom implementation (maybe you’d prefer the whole app was translated into pirate-speak). For most companies and teams, we recommend Lightdash Cloud. To self-host Lightdash securely in production, you should have an excellent understanding of running services with Docker and kubernetes, as well as the security considerations. If you’re unsure whether to self-host or use Lightdash Cloud, here are some things to consider:
##  When to use Lightdash Cloud
Unless you have a specific need to self-host, we recommend using Lightdash Cloud:
  * Suitable for most teams
  * Get started with Lightdash quickly
  * Secure and reliable out-of-the-box.
  * No need to maintain your own infrastructure.
  * Always have the latest version of Lightdash.
  * Incredible support from the core Lightdash team and maintainers.


##  When to self-host
There are a few reasons why you might want to self-host Lightdash:
  * You’re a large enterprise and want to run a proof-of-concept on your own infrastructure. This can be a great way to get your hands on Lightdash, while your infosec team approves the use of Lightdash Cloud.
  * You’re a hobbyist and want to run Lightdash on your own infrastructure.
  * You want to customise Lightdash to your specific needs.
